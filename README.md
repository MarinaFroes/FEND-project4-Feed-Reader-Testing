## Introduction

This Feed Reader Testing is the fourth project of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree.

It is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds with an application but it had an incomplete test suite.

All the files were provided by Udacity including instructions for writing the required tests. 

## Overview

The goal of this project was to learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application, simulating a real work environment.

This project is organized as follows:
 - index.html 
 - README.md
 - /css
   - style.css
   - normalize.css
   - icomoon.css
 - /fonts
   - icomoon.eot
   - icomoon.svg
   - icomoon.ttf
   - icomoon.woff 
 - /images
   - favicon.png -> my logo
 - /js
   - app.js  
 - /jasmine
   - /spec
     - feedreader.js -> contains the tests written by me
  
## How to run this application?

- Download all the files and open index.html on the browser.
- The tests will appear on the bottom of the page.
